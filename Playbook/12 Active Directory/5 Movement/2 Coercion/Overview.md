## Explanation

- **Network** is about exploiting the automatic, often insecure fallbacks and behaviors of network protocols. The use cases generally involve situations where you're on the same network as your target and can intercept or manipulate network traffic. This option is typically less targeted and relies on network misconfigurations or lack of hardening.

- **On Demand**, on the other hand, is more about exploiting specific vulnerabilities or behaviors in Windows and its services. This approach is more targeted, often requires some level of prior access or interaction with the target system, and leverages specific flaws to force authentication, which can then be captured and potentially cracked or relayed.
